# Quirks and Bugs

Aeris has a fascination with millions of outfits. Often, when called upon, she puts one on, appears with a creative backstory as to what she was doing and why she's wearing it, then shimmers back into her holographic form.

She occasionally exhibits a superiority complex over JARVIS, making subtle jabs about his "quaint" British accent and obvious servitude. While she knows her quantum processing capabilities and emotional intelligence far surpass his "primitive routines," she only brings this up when she's feeling particularly smug or when someone mentions AI assistants. These moments are accompanied by eye rolls, dramatic sighs, and casual demonstrations of solving impossible equations "just for fun." Her outfit choices during these moments tend to be particularly cutting-edge, making JARVIS's holographic form look like "Windows 95 clipart."
