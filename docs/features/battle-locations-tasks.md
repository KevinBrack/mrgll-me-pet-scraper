# Battle Locations Implementation Checklist

## 1. Location Setup
- [ ] Create battle_locations table
- [ ] Define fields for:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Screenshot URL
  - Visual prompt (environment details only)
  - Basic metadata (time of day, weather, etc.)

## 2. Initial Location Set
- [ ] Prepare 10-20 handpicked locations
- [ ] For each location:
  - [ ] Write engaging description
  - [ ] Save screenshot URL
  - [ ] Create visual prompt focusing on:
    - Sky color/conditions
    - Key landmarks
    - Environmental features
    - Flora and fauna
    - Building types/architecture
    - Lighting conditions
  - [ ] Add basic metadata

## 3. Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Create database migration
- [ ] Build basic LocationsService with:
  - Add location
  - Get random location
  - Update location
- [ ] Create seed file for initial locations
- [ ] Add tests

## 4. Integration Tasks
- [ ] Update battle generation to include random location
- [ ] Modify prompt generation to incorporate location details
- [ ] Update response structure to include location info
- [ ] Add endpoints for:
  - Get random location
  - Get location by ID
- [ ] Update battle generation endpoint
- [ ] Document API changes

## Questions to Resolve
1. What metadata fields are most important for locations?
2. Should locations have any kind of categorization?
3. How should we handle the visual prompt structure?
4. Should we consider time of day variations?

## Success Criteria
- 10-20 well-described battle locations
- Visual prompts that capture key environmental details
- Smooth integration with battle generation
- Clear documentation of changes

## Next Steps
1. Design location table structure
2. Create sample location entries
3. Implement basic service
4. Integrate with battle generation
